{"index.js":"/*ES6: Create an Export Fallback with export default\nIn the export lesson, you learned about the syntax referred to as a named export. This allowed you to make multiple functions and variables available for use in other files.\n\nThere is another export syntax you need to know, known as export default. Usually you will use this syntax if only one value is being exported from a file. It is also used to create a fallback value for a file or module.\n\nHere is a quick example of export default:\nexport default function add(x,y) {\n  return x + y;\n}\nNote: Since export default is used to declare a fallback value for a module or file, you can only have one value be a default export in each module or file. Additionally, you cannot use export default with var, let, or const\n*/\n\"use strict\";\nexport default function subtract(x,y) {return x - y;}"}
