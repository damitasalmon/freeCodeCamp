    p
      | Percy Julian should be a name known to all of society for the contributions he made to the field of science. He was an African American research chemist and a pioneer in the chemical synthesis of medicinal drugs from plants. His research and development of synthetic compounds made him one of the most significant contributors to science and health care in the 20th century.
